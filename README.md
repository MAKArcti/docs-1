# Welcome to Coordinape

Coordinape is a scalable and permissionless platform for decentralized operations built by Yearn for the demanding needs of our community and other emerging DeFi protocols. 

## Vision

Where DAOs have revolutionized our facility for coordinating decision-making via coin-voting, the shortfalls of these broad consensus-finding mechanisms have become very apparent as weâ€™ve put them to the test across hundreds of communities over the past year. 

While DAOs are often used to micro-manage growing protocols operational decisions such as hiring and compensation, the average coin-holder often lacks the time or expertise to add useful independent agency to a system and is often merely rubber stamping initiatives based on their trust, or lack of trust, in the core team. 

DAOs solve one half of the problems decentralized networks require, Coordinape is a DO (decentralized operations) that aims to solve the other half: a structure to make operational decisions within a team of contributors. If a DAO is the decentralized version of a board of directors plus shareholders, a DO is the decentralized version of the team itself.

Coordinape also provides a visual reflection for DAOs to understand how value flows through the network.
