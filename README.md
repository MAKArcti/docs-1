# Welcome to Coordinape

Coordinape is a scalable and permissionless platform for decentralized operations built by Yearn for the demanding needs of our community and other emerging DeFi protocols. 

## Vision

Where DAOs have revolutionized our facility for coordinating decision-making via coin-voting, the shortfalls of these broad consensus-finding mechanisms have become very apparent as weâ€™ve put them to the test across hundreds of communities over the past year. 

While DAOs are often used to micro-manage growing protocols operational decisions such as hiring and compensation, the average coin-holder often lacks the time or expertise to add useful independent agency to a system and is often merely rubber stamping initiatives based on their trust, or lack of trust, in the core team. 

DAOs solve one half of the problems decentralized networks require, Coordinape is a DO (decentralized operations) that aims to solve the other half: a structure to make operational decisions within a team of contributors. If a DAO is the decentralized version of a board of directors plus shareholders, a DO is the decentralized version of the team itself.

Coordinape also provides a visual reflection for DAOs to understand how value flows through the network.  

## How It Works

Coordinape is currently implemented as an off-chain alpha while we develop an on-chain version, using an EVM compatible L2 or side-chain.

Coordinape is build around Circles - groups of DAO participants that wish to distribute funds together through a decentralized gifting process. Each Circle can define the rules of participation -- it can grow its network permissionlessly, set parameters around certain elements of its game mechanics and toggle network visibility, either through centralized admin or internal governance.  

Circles can also start Epochs: periods of time in which its constituent body of contributors can send eachother GIVE tokens, which represent that Circle's total budget allocation.  We envision Epochs as monthly events, where contributors can consider eachother's collaboration, mutual enablement and furthering of the DAO's mission.  Each member is allocated a fixed amount of GIVE (100 by default), and can send any number of these tokens to other Circle members freely during the Epoch. Members can also opt out if they recieve funding elsewhere, allowing them to send GIVE but not recieve it.  GIVE has no value if it is not given to another Circle member -- the process of gifting defines the per-member payout from the cirle's budget.

When the Epoch ends, the GIVE each member has recieved is swapped for GET: tokens that can be exchanged for a pro rata amount of monthly treasury budget.
