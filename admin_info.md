4. Determine if users will be opted in by default
5. Link your teams Discord to the [Discord bot](https://docs.coordinape.com/welcome/discord\_bot)

### Editing User Settings

1. After the initial upload of users may be edited by clicking the pencil next to their name![](<images/User View.jpg>)
2. Then you can enter their name, starting tokens, admin status, force opt-out, and whether or not they can send GIVE  ![](<images/Edit User.jpg>)
3. Force Opt Out will prevent the user from receiving Give. The user will be alerted to this change via the Telegram Bot, and on the allocations page. If they have had any give allocated prior to making that save it will all be removed, and users who had allocated to them will have to re-allocate to other users.![](<images/Opt Out.jpg>)
4. You can also delete users from the Circle by clicking the trashcan.

### At the end of an epoch export a CSV of the epoch data for analysis and distribution.

![](images/Export.jpg)

You can use either the [dispers.app](https://disperse.app) or the CSV Airdrop in Gnosis safe to distribute you allocations&#x20;

#### **Dispers.app**

In the Disperse app after you have your csv you can distribute the tokens you wish to allocate by pasting the token address into the token address section

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)&#x20;

Then you'll need to take the address and the amount and paste it into the box below.

When you're done make sure it looks ok and then click approve and then disperse token

2. Click apps, search Csv, and select CSV Airdrop

3.  Format your Coordinape csv correctly:

    Preparing a Transfer File

    Transfer files are expected to be in CSV format with the following required columns:

    * **`token_type`**: The type of token that is being transferred. One of `erc20,nft` or `native`. NFT Tokens can be either ERC721 or ERC1155.
    * **`token_address`**: Ethereum address of ERC20 token to be transferred. This has to be left blank for native (ETH) transfers.
    * **`receiver`**: Ethereum address of transfer receiver.
    * **`amount`**: the amount of token to be transferred. This can be left blank for erc721 transfers.
    * **`id`**: The id of the collectible token (erc721 or erc1155) to transfer. This can be left blank for native and erc20 transfers.

    **Important: The CSV file has to use "," as a separator and the header row always has to be provided as the first row and include the described column names.**
4. Upload your csv and click submit.&#x20;

### Best Practices

The best practices will vary from team to team. In general we find teams that communicate their goals for using Coordinape to their contributors will have a better experience than teams that start circles without communicating to their users what

**Team Size**&#x20;

Team sizes can range from 2-200+ but we find it's easier to allocate to smaller teams (<20) so the users can have some interaction with most of the members of the team.

**Compensation Amounts**

The amount of compensation for each epoch can vary, it can be zero, it can be infinity.&#x20;

Before our on chain launch there is no escrow feature so the compensation will be distributed by the admin after the epoch ends.

Once on chain, funds for epochs will be escrowed in the Ape Vaults, and automatically made available to claim or distribute at the end of the epoch after the admin approves the distributions.

**Use Cases We've seen**

* Giving to Contributors
* Giving to  Projects
* Giving to other circles
