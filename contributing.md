### Code Repositories

Our code is hosted on [Github](http://github.com/coordinape/).

* [Frontend](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape)
* [Smart contracts](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape-protocol)

Each repository above includes a README.md in the root of the repo with instructions on getting that app running. Our current Coordinape app runs off-chain, and moving some functionality on-chain is a work in progress.

### Getting Started

To get your development environment started, follow the [README](https://github.com/coordinape/coordinape-backend/blob/main/README.md) in the Frontend repo.

### Questions and Help
