# Enable Vouching

## Setting Up Vouching for your Circle

Via admin controls, a circle admin can decide to enable or disable vouching.  Admins can also set the number of vouches that are needed for circle entry, the period of time a nominee remains available to vouch, and some descriptive text for the module.
