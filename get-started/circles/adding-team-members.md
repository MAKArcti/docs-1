# Adding Team Members

To get your team started in Coordinape, you must add your member's wallet addresses to the circle.

### Adding Circle Member

In the Admin panel, click on "Add Contributor."

### Member Settings

You can edit the following attributes:

* Starting Tokens
* Admin Permissions&#x20;
* GIVE
* Forced Opt-Out&#x20;
* Opt-Out&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Starting Tokens" %}
By default, all users start with 100 GIVE tokens; this can be adjusted when there's no active Epoch [(What's an Epoch?)](../get-started/new-coordinape-admins/start-an-epoch.md) The more tokens a member has, the greater the influence over the member's compensation. Consider lowering starting tokens for newer members or increasing tokens for trusted members.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Are They Admin" %}
Circles can have multiple admins, but be careful because admins will have full access to your circle settings.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Can Give" %}
* If Yes, the Contributor will be able to allocate GIVE
* If No, the contributor will not be able to allocate GIVE
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Forced Opted Out" %}
* If Yes, the contributor will not be able to receive GIVE and will not have the option to Opt-in without admin permission
* If No, the contributor will be able to receive GIVE
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Opted Out" %}
* If No, the contributor will be able to receive GIVE after they Opt-in in their [Epoch settings](../get-started/new-coordinape-admins/record-contributions.md)
* If Yes, the contributor will have Opted in and immediately be eligible to receive GIVE

_Leaving this toggle as NO prevents people from receiving GIVE allocations without logging into Coordinape to allocate to their peers. It may result in them getting fewer allocations if they wait until the end of the epoch to opt-in though_
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
