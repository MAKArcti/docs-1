# ðŸ’² Compensation

Coordinape allows you to decentralize payroll. Here's how:&#x20;

First, members allocate "[GIVE](../give/)" tokens to each other during an [Epoch](../epochs/). These tokens represent a portion of the budget set for the team.&#x20;

Then, after allocation, the Circle Admin exports a CSV and uses their preferred payment method to pay circle members.

The amount of compensation your circle will distribute can vary from $0 to millions of dollars. The only limit is your treasury!&#x20;

### **Vaults** **- Coming Soon**

Soon admins will be able to deposit payroll funds into a Coordinape Vaults to put your payroll to work in Yearn Vaults until payday and then distribute funds to team members.&#x20;
