## Circle Selection

When first visiting the Coordinape website, you will need to connect your wallet.  If you are not able to gain access, your Eth wallet likely has not been added to a Gift Circle.  Contact your administrator if this is the case.

If you do have access to one or more circles, you will see it on the Circle Selection page:

Please note, you will have to connect your wallet when you access a circle for the first time.

## Profile Page

The first time you use Coordinape, you will be asked to answer a couple of questions, which will help your colleagues at Yearn to determine how to GIVE to you.

The first one is a **Profile Statement**.  This can be anything.  It is public for anyone in the Circle to read, and can be used to detail the work you have done this month or clarify what you have been compensated for, and what you want to be compensated for in Coordinape.

The second question is if you will **Opt In or Opt Out** from receiving GIVE for this epoch.  


* If you **Opt Out**, you are signaling that you have other income streams at Yearn which are significant, and you should not be getting Contributor Grant allocations. It will be impossible for others to give to you.

* If you **Opt In**, you will be able to receive grants.  You may use the Profile Statement to detail why.

Either of these settings can be changed over the course of the Epoch, or for future Epochs, by accessing your profile on the Allocation Page to change them.  If you change your status to Opt Out after receiving GIVE during an epoch, any GIVE you have accrued will go back to its senders.
