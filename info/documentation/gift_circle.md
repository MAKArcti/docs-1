# Gift Circle

The Gift Circle allows a group of DAO contributors to decentralize the payment process, identifying each other's value to the organization to create a compensation map.

Compensation is done through a process of Gifting.

## The Gift Circle

An organization can stand up to any number of Gift Circles, adding members through a decentralized process. Then, during a set period (the Epoch), the group can perform the Gifting process as follows:

* At the start of the Epoch, each member of the Circle receives several non-divisible GIVE tokens (Determined by the Circle Admin)
* Members allocate their GIVE tokens to other members throughout the Epoch to reward them for the value they bring to the Circle.
* Members can adjust their allocations up until the end of the Epoch.
* They can add notes to their allocations if they wish
* At the end of the Epoch, all allocated GIVE tokens become locked (now called GET tokens), and all unallocated GIVE tokens are burned.
* Budget distribution is then formulated according to the percentage of total GET tokens that each member of the circles has received.

## Example

* Joe receives 75 GETs over the Epoch from his colleagues,
* Total GETs allocated during the Epoch are 1500,
* The total Contributor Budget is 50,000 USDC
* Circle Admin sends Joe 2,500 USDC (0.05 of the Budget).
